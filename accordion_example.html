          <p>This is a growing map of MMIW/P resources available across Turtle Island. The map was co-developed with MIT Students & Waking Women Healing Institute to quickly locate agencies, non-profits, grassroots, and organizations that provide direct services to families of MMIW/P and Survivors of Violence. The hope is to improve responses to and increase access to supports for those experiencing violence and cases of MMIW/P. By clicking on each dot, a pop-up opens that shares location, contact details, and services available for each entity, where we could find them. We invite you to explore the MMIW/P Resource Map.</p>
